I'll brag about you to my friends if...
Green flags I look for...
I'm looking for...
Something that's a non-negotiable for me is...
The hallmark of a good relationship is...
We're the same type of weird if...
All I ask is that you...
I'll fall for you if...
We'll get along if...
I want someone who...
I'm weirdly attracted to...
